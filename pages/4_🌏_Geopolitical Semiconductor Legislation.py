        - Chip EQUIP Act (Not Yet Passed): Seeks to ban semiconductor manufacturers funded under the CHIPS Act from using specialized manufacturing equipment sourced from a 'foreign entity of concern' to 'stop China and other foreign entities of concern from compromising our microchip manufacturing facilities,' and strengthen national security.
        - Increased profitability for major beneficiaries of the subsidies and tax incentives (likely US firms like AMD and Intel).
        - Reduced dependence on foreign suppliers.
        - Likely to increase trade tensions with China due to limiting their profitability as a result of this Act.

        - Chinese firms such as SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor, and YMTC will see significant profits due to increased government investments. However, for foreign firms that operate or trade with China, there may be operation or supply chain issues as a result of China's increased focus on domestic production and reducing dependence on foreign partners.
