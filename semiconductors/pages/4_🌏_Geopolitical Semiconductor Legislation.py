           _Industrial Innovation Act_:Chipmakers will be able to file for tax credits of 5% of their annual costs for purchasing equipment for advanced nodes (usually the costliest part of chip manufacturing) and a 25% tax bread on R&D expenses
            - Taiwanese Ministery of Economic Affairs states that this will encourage higher domestic investment in homegrown tech businessses like TSMC, MediaTek, GlobalWafers, UMC, Phison,  especially for R&D
            - Aims to maintain Taiwan's competitive edge in the semiconductor industry, currently holding 68% of the global semiconductor market, with TSMC alone with a market share of 53%.

        - Increased profitability for major beneficiaries of the subsidies and tax incentives (likely US firms like AMD and Intel).
        - Reduced dependence on foreign suppliers.
        - Likely to increase trade tensions with China due to limiting their profitability as a result of this Act.

        - Chinese firms such as SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor, and YMTC will see significant profits due to increased government investments. However, for foreign firms that operate or trade with China, there may be operation or supply chain issues as a result of China's increased focus on domestic production and reducing dependence on foreign partners.
