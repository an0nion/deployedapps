Doped semiconductors with impurities introduced are also called _extrinsic_ semiconductors whereas pure semiconductors are called _intrinsic_ semiconductors.

The most common pentavalent elements used to dope semiconductors are bismuth, antimony, phosphorus and arsenic. When bonded with silicon, each pentavalent element has 1 extra, unbonded electron, resulting in free electrons, giving this field a negative charge, hence, _N-Node_.

The most common trivalent elements to dope semiconductors with are boron and aluminium.  When bonded with silicon, each trivalent element present results in a hole in the crystal lattice, where the lattice is lacking electrons. As a result, there is a strong positive charge in this region, thus giving the name, _P-Node_.

                  end of the battery. At the P-Node, they are \
