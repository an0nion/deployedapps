         movement of asset prices, usually in the context of stock prices within\
          financial markets. The GBM assumes that stock prices move randomly, \
         but with a general trend (referred to as drift) and random fluctuations\
          (referred to as volatility). Furthermore, the GBM operates by\
          continuously calculating very small changes in stock prices of \

            The two main components of Geometric Brownian Motion are drift and volatility.
            - _Drift_: The drift of a stock or asset represents\
            its average rate of return of the stock over time. 
            - _Volatility_: The volatility of a stock or asset measures the degree of variation\
            in price of an asset or stock over time.

            prices in the Black-Scholes model, and is the _most_ widely\
            used model of stock price behaviour. Furthermore, it is also used for the following:
            - _Option Pricing & Derivatives Trading_: GBM is a key component of the Black-Scholes model, one of the most\
            widely used models for pricing options contracts. You can find my Options Pricing Calculator\
            on this web app, at the _Black-Scholes Model_ tab.
            - _Portfolio Optimsation_: The GBM is used to model the behaviour of diversified investment portfolios\
            over time.

    st.write("""
            Non-financial uses:
            - _Biostatistics and Population Modelling_: The GBM can also be used to model population growth, disease spread, and other biological diffusion processes
            - _Physics and Brownian Motion_: GBM is particularly applicable in the study of Brownian motion\
            , which is the study of random movement of particles suspended in fluid. the GBM can be used to\
            model the trajectory of particles undergoing Brownian motion.
